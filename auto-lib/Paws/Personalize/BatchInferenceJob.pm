=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize::BatchInferenceJob

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Personalize::BatchInferenceJob object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BatchInferenceJobArn => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::BatchInferenceJob object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BatchInferenceJobArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information on a batch inference job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BatchInferenceJobArn => Str

  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the batch inference job.


=head2 CreationDateTime => Str

  The time at which the batch inference job was created.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

  If the batch inference job failed, the reason for the failure.


=head2 JobInput => Personalize_BatchInferenceJobInput

  The Amazon S3 path that leads to the input data used to generate the
batch inference job.


=head2 JobName => Str

  The name of the batch inference job.


=head2 JobOutput => Personalize_BatchInferenceJobOutput

  The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the output data generated by the
batch inference job.


=head2 LastUpdatedDateTime => Str

  The time at which the batch inference job was last updated.


=head2 NumResults => Int

  The number of recommendations generated by the batch inference job.
This number includes the error messages generated for failed input
records.


=head2 RoleArn => Str

  The ARN of the Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
requested the batch inference job.


=head2 SolutionVersionArn => Str

  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version from which the
batch inference job was created.


=head2 Status => Str
