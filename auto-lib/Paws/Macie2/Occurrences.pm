=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::Occurrences

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::Occurrences object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Cells => $value, ..., Records => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::Occurrences object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Cells

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the location of 1-15 occurrences of sensitive data that was
detected by managed data identifiers or a custom data identifier and
produced a sensitive data finding.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Cells => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Macie2::Cell>]

An array of objects, one for each occurrence of sensitive data in a
Microsoft Excel workbook, CSV file, or TSV file. Each object specifies
the cell or field that contains the data. This value is null for all
other types of files.


=head2 LineRanges => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Macie2::Range>]

An array of objects, one for each occurrence of sensitive data in a
Microsoft Word document or non-binary text file, such as an HTML, JSON,
TXT, or XML file. Each object specifies the line that contains the
data, and the position of the data on that line.

This value is often null for file types that are supported by Cell,
Page, or Record objects. Exceptions are the locations of data in:
unstructured sections of an otherwise structured file, such as a
comment in a file; a malformed file that Amazon Macie analyzes as plain
text; and, a CSV or TSV file that has any column names that contain
sensitive data.


=head2 OffsetRanges => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Macie2::Range>]

An array of objects, one for each occurrence of sensitive data in a
binary text file. Each object specifies the position of the data
relative to the beginning of the file.

This value is typically null. For binary text files, Amazon Macie adds
location data to a lineRanges.Range or Page object, depending on the
file type.


=head2 Pages => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Macie2::Page>]

An array of objects, one for each occurrence of sensitive data in an
Adobe Portable Document Format file. Each object specifies the page
that contains the data, and the position of the data on that page. This
value is null for all other types of files.


=head2 Records => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Macie2::Record>]

An array of objects, one for each occurrence of sensitive data in an
Apache Avro object container or Apache Parquet file. Each object
specifies the record index and the path to the field in the record that
contains the data. This value is null for all other types of files.
