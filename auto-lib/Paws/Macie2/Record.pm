Paws::Macie2::Record

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::Record object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { JsonPath => $value, ..., RecordIndex => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::Record object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->JsonPath

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the location of an occurrence of sensitive data in an Apache
Avro object container or Apache Parquet file.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 JsonPath => Str

The path, as a JSONPath expression, to the field in the record that
contains the data. If Amazon Macie detects sensitive data in the name
of any element in the path, Macie omits this field.

If the name of an element exceeds 20 characters, Macie truncates the
name by removing characters from the beginning of the name. If the
resulting full path exceeds 250 characters, Macie also truncates the
path, starting with the first element in the path, until the path
contains 250 or fewer characters.


=head2 RecordIndex => Int

The record index, starting from 0, for the record that contains the
data.
