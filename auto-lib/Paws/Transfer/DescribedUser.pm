=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::DescribedUser

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::DescribedUser object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., UserName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::DescribedUser object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the properties of a user that was specified.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user that was
requested to be described.


=head2 HomeDirectory => Str

Specifies the landing directory (or folder), which is the location that
files are written to or read from in an Amazon S3 bucket, for the
described user. An example is I<
C<your-Amazon-S3-bucket-nameE<gt>/home/username> >.


=head2 HomeDirectoryMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Transfer::HomeDirectoryMapEntry>]

Specifies the logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3
paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make
them visible. You will need to specify the "C<Entry>" and "C<Target>"
pair, where C<Entry> shows how the path is made visible and C<Target>
is the actual Amazon S3 path. If you only specify a target, it will be
displayed as is. You will need to also make sure that your AWS Identity
and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in C<Target>.

In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope-down policy
to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To
do this, you can set C<Entry> to '/' and set C<Target> to the
HomeDirectory parameter value.


=head2 HomeDirectoryType => Str

Specifies the type of landing directory (folder) you mapped for your
users to see when they log into the file transfer protocol-enabled
server. If you set it to C<PATH>, the user will see the absolute Amazon
S3 bucket paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you
set it C<LOGICAL>, you will need to provide mappings in the
C<HomeDirectoryMappings> for how you want to make Amazon S3 paths
visible to your users.


=head2 Policy => Str

Specifies the name of the policy in use for the described user.


=head2 PosixProfile => L<Paws::Transfer::PosixProfile>




=head2 Role => Str

Specifies the IAM role that controls your users' access to your Amazon
S3 bucket. The policies attached to this role will determine the level
of access you want to provide your users when transferring files into
and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or buckets. The IAM role should also
contain a trust relationship that allows a server to access your
resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.


=head2 SshPublicKeys => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Transfer::SshPublicKey>]

Specifies the public key portion of the Secure Shell (SSH) keys stored
for the described user.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Transfer::Tag>]

Specifies the key-value pairs for the user requested. Tag can be used
to search for and group users for a variety of purposes.


=head2 UserName => Str

Specifies the name of the user that was requested to be described. User
names are used for authentication purposes. This is the string that
will be used by your user when they log in to your server.
