  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FirewallManagerStatement => $value, ..., VisibilityConfig => $value  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A rule group that's defined for an AWS Firewall Manager WAF policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FirewallManagerStatement => L<Paws::WAFV2::FirewallManagerStatement>

The processing guidance for an AWS Firewall Manager rule. This is like
a regular rule Statement, but it can only contain a rule group
reference.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the rule group. You cannot change the name of a rule group
after you create it.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OverrideAction => L<Paws::WAFV2::OverrideAction>




=head2 B<REQUIRED> Priority => Int

If you define more than one rule group in the first or last Firewall
Manager rule groups, AWS WAF evaluates each request against the rule
groups in order, starting from the lowest priority setting. The
priorities don't need to be consecutive, but they must all be
different.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VisibilityConfig => L<Paws::WAFV2::VisibilityConfig>





=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::WAFV2>
