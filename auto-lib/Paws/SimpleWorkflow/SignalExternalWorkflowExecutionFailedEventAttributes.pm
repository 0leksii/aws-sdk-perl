=head1 NAME

Paws::SimpleWorkflow::SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SimpleWorkflow::SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Cause => $value, ..., WorkflowId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SimpleWorkflow::SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Cause

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the details of the C<SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed>
event.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Cause => Str

  The cause of the failure. This information is generated by the system
and can be useful for diagnostic purposes.

If C<cause> is set to C<OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED>, the decision failed
because it lacked sufficient permissions. For details and example IAM
policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html)
in the I<Amazon SWF Developer Guide>.


=head2 Control => Str

  The data attached to the event that the decider can use in subsequent
workflow tasks. This data isn't sent to the workflow execution.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DecisionTaskCompletedEventId => Int

  The ID of the C<DecisionTaskCompleted> event corresponding to the
decision task that resulted in the C<SignalExternalWorkflowExecution>
decision for this signal. This information can be useful for diagnosing
problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InitiatedEventId => Int

  The ID of the C<SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated> event
corresponding to the C<SignalExternalWorkflowExecution> decision to
request this signal. This information can be useful for diagnosing
problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.


=head2 RunId => Str

  The C<runId> of the external workflow execution that the signal was
being delivered to.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WorkflowId => Str

  The C<workflowId> of the external workflow execution that the signal
was being delivered to.
