- generate documentation for methods generated by JSONAttributes
- length restrictions for atts
- Paginated results and iterators
- Waiters (methods that wait for an object to be in a determined state)
- Retrying
- Handle StrToObj Maps in JSON, REST*, EC2 (if appliable) API Builders
- Exception handling
  - Manage 'return' value from
    - ec2-assign-private-ip-addresses.xml
    - ec2-associate-address.xml
    - ... lot's more in EC2 API ...
- JSON callers
  - when a boolean is returned from API, it doesn't get properly handed to 
    result objects (error thrown)
- rest-xml callers for rest-xml services
- json-xml callers for json-xml services
- enums for results may be too strict. If AWS returns something new, an exception
  is raised
- enums should be validated when calling, and not validating when being returned from
  APIs
- Objects that can ->Delete, or ->Update, calling service->Update(Id => ...)
- Build classes at runtime?
- ResultParser and UnwrappedParser can maybe be fusioned. They're almost the same 
- Validate Enums when passing params
- for RDS and RedShift lists: adapt code so that botocore jsons don't have to be changed
