 - The default CredentialProviderChain will now try to read an ini
   file in ~/.aws/credentials with the aws credentials
 - The Credential providers have been moved into Paws::Credential namespace
 - The role that all Credential Providers have to add is now Paws::Credential

 - Paws->service and $aws->service no longer return a class that
   has to be constructed. Instead they return an INSTANCE of the
   class. Attributes for the constructor can be passed as the 
   subsequent parameters of ->service.
   A method class_for_service returns the service class in the "old"
   fashion
   ->service('X')->new(region => 'Y') is now
   ->service('X', region => 'Y')
   or
   ->class_for_service('X')->new(region => 'Y')

   The recommended one is ->service('X', region => 'Y')
