 - Difference between SQS message AttributeMaps and QueueAttribute maps (thnks codehead) 
 - Paws now returns structured exceptions (Paws::Exception) with information of errors from
   the APIs. The exceptions stringify so you don't have to worry about too much breakage. If you
   were parsing the error message from the exception, you should now use Paws::Exceptions accessors
   to get the already parsed information
 - Refactoring in the different callers to move functionalities only where needed
 - Refactored the config attribute of the Paws class. Also documented what you can configure from
   the config, so now the "config" is official.

 - Paws->service and $aws->service no longer return a class that
   has to be constructed. Instead they return an INSTANCE of the
   class. Attributes for the constructor can be passed as the 
   subsequent parameters of ->service.
   A method class_for_service returns the service class in the "old"
   fashion
   ->service('X')->new(region => 'Y') is now
   ->service('X', region => 'Y')
   or
   ->class_for_service('X')->new(region => 'Y')

   The recommended one is ->service('X', region => 'Y')
