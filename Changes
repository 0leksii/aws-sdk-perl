0.13
 - New API: DynamoDB Streams
 - New API: DeviceFarm
 - Paws::Credentials::File. Support for changing the filename via ENVIRONMENT (AWS_CONFIG_FILE)
 - Information for calculating region endpoints is moved into service classes, not the RegionInfo
   class that holds all endpoint information for all services.
 - Rename RegionalEndpointCaller role to EndpointResolver
 - Throw structured exception if an endpoint can't be calculated
 - Support for STS regional endpoint when used passing a region to $paws->service('STS', region => 'Desired region'). 
   $paws->service('STS') still uses the global sts.amazonaws.com endpoint
 - Signin service working again (still hand-coded...)
 - paws cli now displays all attributes for call parameters, and their requiredness

0.10 01 Jul 2015

 - Paws::Net::Caller was not correctly handling cases where the API only returns success (1) (osoriano)
 - Tests don't use Data::Path anymore (using own "mini-implementation")

 - API updates from botocore until 2015-06-29
 - Difference between SQS message AttributeMaps and QueueAttribute maps (thnks codehead) 
 - Paws now returns structured exceptions (Paws::Exception) with information of errors from
   the APIs. The exceptions stringify so you don't have to worry about too much breakage. If you
   were parsing the error message from the exception, you should now use Paws::Exceptions accessors
   to get the already parsed information
 - Refactoring in the different callers to move functionalities only where needed
 - Endpoint resolution support (first version by IÃ±igo Tejedor)
 - SQS Maps are now working correctly (QueueMaps were ill defined). Thanks to codehead
 - Fix bug for JSONCaller: when response doesn't have a body, the operation would succeed, but an
   invalid json string exception was thrown
 - longs changed to Moose type Int, instead of Num (longs are 64 bit integers 
   in Java https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)
   Those Ints are passed to AWS as int() instead of Strings, because AWS APIs (CloudWatchLogs
   for example) isn't able to transform String to long (we get an API error)
 - Refactored the config attribute of the Paws class. Also documented what you can configure from
   the config, so now the "config" is official.
 - BugFix: some Map attributes in JSON APIs were incorrectly being created as Maps of Strings, instead of Maps of Objects.
   Affected APIs are: CloudSearchDomain, CloudWatchLogs, CognitoIdentity, Config, DataPipeline, DynamoDB, EMR, Kinesis
   MachineLearning, OpsWorks, S3 and StorageGateway.

 - The default CredentialProviderChain will now try to read an ini
   file in ~/.aws/credentials with the aws credentials
 - The Credential providers have been moved into Paws::Credential namespace
 - The role that all Credential Providers have to add is now Paws::Credential
2015-02-09
 - Paws->service and $aws->service no longer return a class that
   has to be constructed. Instead they return an INSTANCE of the
   class. Attributes for the constructor can be passed as the 
   subsequent parameters of ->service.
   A method class_for_service returns the service class in the "old"
   fashion
   ->service('X')->new(region => 'Y') is now
   ->service('X', region => 'Y')
   or
   ->class_for_service('X')->new(region => 'Y')

   The recommended one is ->service('X', region => 'Y')
2015-02-10
 - Adding paginators broke lots of classes (not loading)
   deactivated paginators on json, query and restxml classes
   The only guys who conserves paginators is EC2
